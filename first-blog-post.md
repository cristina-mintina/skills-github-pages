Stupid poem I wrote in an effort to make my son laugh about a homework assignment he had for school.

Cheerios
there's no mystery:
Cheerios are the most
cereal-y cereal in America - the branding on the boxes, unmistakeable.
Imagine high-grade cardboard
Now, chop it into bite-sized pieces
Gather into a bowl
Pour in some milk
Grab a spoon
Scoop those cardboard O's
and - if there's no limit
to your bravery -
take a bite.
